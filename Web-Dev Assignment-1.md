 Web-Dev Assignment-1


Ques 1: Explain the difference between frontend, backend, and full-stack development with suitable real-world examples.

Ans: Frontend Development:-
	Frontend is the part of a website or app that users directly see and interact with. It includes everything visible on the screen — like buttons, images, forms, colors, and layouts.
	Example: When you open Amazon or Flipkart, all the product images, search bars, and the “Add to Cart” button are part of the frontend.  Common technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Angular.

     Backend Development:-
	Backend is the hidden part that works behind the website. It handles the logic, database, and communication between the website and the server.
	Example: When you click “Add to Cart,” the backend decides which product was added, stores it in your account, and updates the total price. Common technologies: Node.js, Java, Python, PHP, MySQL, MongoDB.

     Full-Stack Development:-
	A full-stack developer can work on both frontend and backend. They design the user interface and also build the server, database, and application logic.
	Example: If a single developer creates both the login page (frontend) and the system that stores login data (backend), that person is a full-stack developer. Common stacks: MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

Ques2: Create a simple diagram showing how the client-server model works in web architecture.

Ans:      +------------------+
          |      Client      |
          |  (Browser/User)  |
          +--------+---------+
                   |
                   | 1️⃣ Sends Request (e.g., open a website)
                            v
         	   +--------+---------+
          		|      Server      | 
          	  |  (Backend System) |
          	  +--------+---------+
                  		  |
                   | 2️⃣ Processes request, fetches data
                   v
          +--------+---------+
          |     Database     |
          |   (Data Storage) |
          +--------+---------+
                   |
                   | 3️⃣ Sends Data Back
                   v
          +------------------+
          |      Client      |
          |   (Shows Result) |
          +------------------+



Ques3: Describe how a browser requests and displays a web page from a web server.

Ans: When you type a website address in your browser and press Enter, the browser asks the web server for the webpage. Here’s how it works:

Sending the Request:
The browser sends a request over the internet saying, “Hey, I need this webpage!” The request reaches the server that hosts the site.

Server Processes:
The server receives the request, fetches any necessary data from its database or files, and prepares the webpage to send back.

Sending the Response:
The server sends the webpage back to the browser. This usually includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.

Displaying the Page:
The browser reads these files and renders the page so you can see the content and interact with it, like clicking buttons or scrolling.

Ques4: Identify and list the tools required to set up a web development environment. Explain the purpose of each.
	
Ans: To start web development, you need a few essential tools. Here’s a list with their purpose:

Code Editor / IDE

This is where you write your code—HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or backend languages. A good editor highlights syntax, helps with auto-completion, and makes coding faster.

2. Web Browser
Browsers are used to test and view your webpages. They render HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so you can see how your website looks and behaves.

3. Local Server / Development Server 

For backend development, you need a server to run your code locally. It helps you test dynamic websites and databases on your own computer before publishing online.

4. Version Control System

This keeps track of your code changes, lets you revert to earlier versions, and helps collaborate with others on projects.

5. Web Browser Developer Tools 

These tools let you inspect your webpage, debug JavaScript, check network requests, and experiment with styles in real-time.

6. Package Managers

These help you install libraries, frameworks, and tools that make development easier and faster.

7. Optional: Database 

If your website stores data like user accounts or posts, you’ll need a database to save and manage that information.

Ques5: Explain what a web server is and give examples of commonly used servers.

Ans: A web server is a computer or software that stores website files (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) and delivers them to users when they request a webpage. Basically, when you type a website address in your browser, the browser sends a request to the web server, and the server sends back the webpage so you can see it.

Examples of commonly used web servers:

	Apache HTTP Server – One of the most popular and widely used servers.

	Nginx – Known for handling lots of traffic efficiently.

	Microsoft IIS – Web server used mainly with Windows servers.

Ques6: Define the roles of a frontend developer, backend developer, and database administrator in a project.

Ans: Frontend Developer:

	Responsible for everything the user sees and interacts with on a website or app.

	Works with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React or Angular to design pages, buttons, forms, and make the interface user-friendly.

     Backend Developer:

	Handles the “behind-the-scenes” part of a website that users don’t see.

	Works with servers, APIs, and backend languages like Java, Python, Node.js to process requests, manage authentication, and connect the frontend to the database.

     Database Administrator (DBA):

	Manages the database where all the project’s data is stored.

	Ensures data is organized, secure, and efficiently retrievable. Handles backups, performance, and data integrity.

Ques7: Install VS Code and configure it for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript development. Take a screenshot of the setup.

Ans: 

Ques8: Explain the difference between static and dynamic websites. Provide an example of each.

Ans: Static Website:

	A static website has fixed content that does not change unless the developer manually updates it.

	It’s usually made with simple HTML, CSS, and maybe some images, and every visitor sees the same content.

	Example: A personal portfolio website or a company’s basic “About Us” page.

     Dynamic Website:

	A dynamic website can change content automatically based on user interaction, time, or data from a database.

	It uses backend programming like PHP, Python, or Node.js along with a database to show different content to different users.

	Example: Facebook, Amazon, or any e-commerce website where content updates frequently.

Ques9: Research and list five web browsers. Explain how rendering engines differ between them.

Ans: Five Popular Web Browsers:

	Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari, Opera

     Rendering Engines and How They Differ:

	Rendering Engine is the part of a browser that reads website code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and displays it on the screen.

	Chrome & Edge (Chromium-based) use Blink, which is fast, supports modern web standards, and is good at handling complex web pages.

	Firefox uses Gecko, which focuses on web standards compliance and flexibility.
	
	Safari uses WebKit, optimized for Apple devices and energy efficiency.

	Opera also uses Blink (like Chrome) but may include extra features like a built-in VPN.

Ques10: Draw a labeled diagram showing the basic web architecture flow — client, server, database, and APIs.

Ans:      +------------------+
          |      Client      |
          |  (Browser/User)  |
          +--------+---------+
